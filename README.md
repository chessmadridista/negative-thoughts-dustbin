## Deleting Thoughts 🚮

Each thought you write will be displayed as a card. You have the power to release the negativity associated with each thought in two ways:

### Delete Single Thought 🗑️

On each thought's card, you'll find a little bin icon. Click on it, and watch as the thought is instantly shredded and removed from your life. Feel the weight lifting off your shoulders with each deletion.
